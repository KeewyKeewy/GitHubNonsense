Idea: Mario Maker Mode:
	- scan for code format
	- save w/ user name
	- when streamer wants next code
		-> bot spits out code w/ user name of who sent said code

Idea: Quote command:

have a !quote command that sends a message of a random quote form a list of quotes.
And a !writequote command for mods to save new quotes to the file.
