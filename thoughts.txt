For a !pet command on/off state, have a mod-only function !beckon and !ignore (from Greater Dog fight) for on/off state.
- Maybe have state off by default as it is a very spammable command.

The !NERD command does a little too much to be a public command.  Should make that a mod only thing to keep it from being spammed.  Or remove it cause it's kinda silly and nobody cares. That may also be a reason to keep it.
