The !NERD command does a little too much to be a public command.  Should make that a mod only thing to keep it from being spammed.  Or remove it cause it's kinda silly and nobody cares. That may also be a reason to keep it.


Made an on/off state for the !pet command.  State can be set in one chat without affecting other chats.  Probably could have done better.  Also that command is long as fuck.
